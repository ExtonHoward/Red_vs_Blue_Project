# Red_vs_Blue_Project
The purporse of this project was to play both sides of the coin, one as a Red Team Penetration Tester and the other as a Blue Team SOC Analyst using the Elastic Stack (ELk).

* Find vulnerabilities and exploits to gain access to the web server running Apache
* Analyze logs of attack using the Elastic Stack (ELK) tool Kibana to determine indicators of attack and compromise
* Document the results including the attack, the analysis, and recommendations for hardening the system

All the documentation is organized here for you to see what the machine was vulnerable to, how the machine was exploited, the findings and analysis of the Red Team and Blue Team, and the mitigation recommendations to improve the security of the system.
